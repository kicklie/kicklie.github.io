**Sentences:**
- But when Daddy Pig takes his glasses off, he can’t see things clearly. Everything looks a bit soft and fuzzy.
- It makes him very grumpy.
- Do you remember where you last put them, Daddy Pig?
- George, be careful not to knock anything over.
- It’s not funny.
- If I move slowly I won’t bump into things.
